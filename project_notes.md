## 💡 Strategic Improvements

| Category | Item | Priority | Status |
|----------|------|----------|--------|
| **Testing** | CI/CD with GitHub Actions | High | Planned |
| **UX** | Custom theme creation (Church tier) | Medium | Suggested |
| **DevOps** | Automated deployment pipeline | High | Planned |
| **Security** | MFA for admins | Medium | Suggested |
| **Analytics** | Theme usage trends over time | Low | Future |

### Detailed Suggestions

#### 1. Complete i18n for User Preferences 🆕
- **Current Implementation**: User preferences UI has English translations only
- **Reason for Change**: Match existing multi-language support (ES, FR, RU)
- **Proposed Change**: Add 30+ translation keys to `es.json`, `fr.json`, `ru.json`
- **Benefit**: Global accessibility for preference settings

#### 2. Automated CI/CD Pipeline
- **Current Implementation**: Manual testing and deployment
- **Reason for Change**: Ensure no regressions, automate quality gates
- **Proposed Change**: GitHub Actions workflow running backend tests, frontend tests, and E2E on PR
- **Resources**: [GitHub Actions for Python](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/automating-builds-and-tests/building-and-testing-python)
- **Benefit**: Faster iteration, production confidence

#### 3. Custom Theme Creation (Church Tier Feature)
- **Current Implementation**: Fixed theme palette per tier
- **Reason for Change**: Premium differentiation and white-label potential
- **Proposed Change**: UI builder allowing Church tier users to customize:
  - Primary/accent colors
  - Font selections  
  - Logo upload
  - Custom CSS variables
- **Benefit**: Ultimate tier value proposition, brand customization

#### 4. Theme Usage Analytics Dashboard
- **Current Implementation**: Static snapshot of current theme distribution
- **Reason for Change**: Track adoption trends and seasonal preferences
- **Proposed Change**: Time-series chart showing theme popularity over weeks/months
- **Benefit**: Data-driven theme design decisions
