# How Called & Equipped Works (Pastor Overview)

Called & Equipped is designed to **support discernment**, not replace leadership or pastoral care.  
This page explains, in simple terms, how the system functions and how information flows.

---

## Big Picture
People → Discernment → Understanding → Stewardship


The platform helps individuals reflect on how God may be working in their lives, while giving churches tools to **steward gifts responsibly**.

## The Flow (Plain Language)

```text
A Person

   ▼
Results Are Stored Safely
   │
   ▼
Church Leaders See Summaries
(not private details)
```

## What Individuals Experience

- Individuals complete a guided discernment process
    
- Results are presented as **indicators**, not labels
    
- Scripture is shown in the user’s language where possible
    
- Personal preferences (themes, language) remain private
    
- Results belong first to the individual
    

> The system does not diagnose, rank, or assign callings.

---

## What Church Leaders See

- Participation and completion summaries
    
- Aggregate insights (not private answers)
    
- Ministry-wide trends that support conversation
    
- Tools to steward people without surveilling them
    

Leaders **cannot**:

- See private preferences
    
- Change individual results
    
- Override discernment outcomes
    

---

## How Organizations Are Handled

Each church or ministry has its **own secure space**.

- Data does not mix between churches
    
- Leaders only see information from their own organization
    
- Demo environments are read-only and isolated
    

This protects both trust and accountability.

---

## Safeguards Built In

- The system always defers to human leadership
    
- Results are versioned and never rewritten
    
- Permissions are enforced by the system, not by individuals
    
- No information is sold, mined, or shared externally
    

---

## What the System Is Not

- Not a personality test
    
- Not a replacement for prayer or pastoral wisdom
    
- Not a tool for ranking or comparison
    
- Not a surveillance or compliance system
    

*Called & Equipped* exists to **serve the Church**, not manage it.

---

## Summary

Called & Equipped provides:

- Structure without control
    
- Insight without intrusion
    
- Technology without replacing discernment
    

It is a tool to help churches faithfully steward the people God has entrusted to them.
