# Feature Set

Called & Equipped is designed to balance **individual reflection** with **organizational stewardship**.

## 📝 Core Assessment Experience

The heart of the platform is a theologically grounded, user-friendly assessment interface.

- **Dynamic Scripture Localization**: Users can complete assessments with scripture references in their preferred translation (ESV, KJV, etc.) and language (English, Spanish, French, Russian).
- **History & Trends**: Users can retake assessments over time to see how their discernment evolves. Historical results are preserved, not overwritten.
- **Contextual Explanations**: Results include theological definitions and scripture references, not just raw scores.
- **Accessibility First**: High-contrast "Midnight Sanctuary" dark mode and responsive mobile design ensure the tool is usable by everyone.

## 🏛️ Organization & Ministry Tools

For churches and ministries, we provide tools to steward the community, not just manage users.

- **Multi-Tenancy**: Organizations serve as secure, isolated containers for their members and data.
- **Role-Based Provisioning**: Granular roles (Owner, Admin, Member) ensure reputable access control.
- **Invitation System**: Secure email-based invitations for on-boarding staff and lay leaders.
- **Member Management**: Directory views with quick filters for active/inactive members and assessment status.

## 📊 Analytics & Discernment Aids

Data is presented to spark conversation, not label individuals.

- **Individual Insights**: Visual radar and bar charts highlights simple gift clusters and potential "blind spots".
- **Aggregate Reporting**: (Growth/Enterprise) View the "gift topology" of the entire organization to identify collective strengths and gaps.
- **Member Deep-Dive**: Interactive modals allow pastors to review a member's history and detailed responses alongside them.

## 🛡️ Security, Privacy & Stewardship

Trust is our currency.

- **Tiered Entitlements**: Features are enforced by the backend, ensuring data integrity across subscription tiers.
- **Audit Logging**: Critical actions (role changes, settings updates) are logged for accountability.
- **Data Boundaries**: Strict org-scoping prevents data leakage between ministries.
- **Privacy Controls**: Users retain ownership of their history; organizations only see what is explicitly shared within their context.
