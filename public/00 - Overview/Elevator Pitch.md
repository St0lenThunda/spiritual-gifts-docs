## 🎯 Primary Elevator Pitch (Canonical)

**Called & Equipped** helps churches discern and develop spiritual gifts in a way that is biblically grounded, pastor-guided, and organizationally responsible.

Our platform combines a theologically careful assessment, Scripture-anchored explanations, and privacy-first aggregate insights—ensuring gifts are _discerned with wisdom_ and shared with accountability. Pastors retain oversight, individuals gain clarity, and churches receive tools to steward people well across ministries, cultures, and denominations.

It’s not about defining people by a test—it’s about helping the Church recognize how God is already at work.
