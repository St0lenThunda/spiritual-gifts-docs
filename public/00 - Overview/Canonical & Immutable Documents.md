# Canonical & Immutable Documents

To prevent "vision drift" over time, the following documents are considered **Immutable Foundations**. They define the core identity, theology, and ethical boundaries of *Called & Equipped*.

Changes to these documents require:
1.  Significant deliberation.
2.  Explicit rationale (documented via ADR).
3.  Confirmation that the core mission remains intact.

All other documentation (implementation details, operational guides, feature specs) is allowed and encouraged to evolve.

## ⚖️ Governance Rule

> [!NOTE] 
> Public documentation is derived exclusively via explicit #public tags. Untagged documents are assumed internal by default.
