# Pricing Philosophy

We view revenue as simple **stewardship** to keep the platform sustainable, not as a means of extraction.

## Principles

1.  **Access for All**: The basic assessment should be accessible to the smallest church plant. (Hence the low-cost "Starter" tier).
2.  **Organization Pays**: Individuals never pay. The church invests in its people.
3.  **Value-Based Upgrades**: Higher tiers unlock *organizational* value (features for leaders), not *spiritual* value (the assessment itself is always full-featured).
4.  **No Ads**: We will never sell user data or show ads. The customer is the customer, not the product.

## Pricing Mechanics
- **SaaS Model**: Recurring revenue ensures long-term maintenance and security updates.
- **Fair Use Limits**: "Assessments per month" caps prevent abuse while accommodating normal growth.

## Governance & Safety
*All organizations, including free plans, require administrator approval before members gain access. Advanced approval workflows and audit capabilities are available in paid tiers.*

This aligns with our belief that safety is a boundary, not a feature. Basic protection (Manual Approval) is universal; advanced governance (Bulk Actions, Workflows) scales with organizational complexity.
