# Called & Equipped — A Pastor’s Summary

Called & Equipped is a digital support tool for churches seeking to steward spiritual insight responsibly.

It helps preserve reflection, support follow-up, and reduce pastoral burden—without replacing discernment, enforcing theology, or automating ministry decisions.

• No spiritual authority claims  
• No automated placements  
• No theological enforcement  

Built to support care, continuity, and trust.

Technology doesn’t discern calling.  
But it can help churches listen more carefully together.
