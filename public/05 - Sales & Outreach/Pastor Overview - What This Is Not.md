# What This Is Not

Called & Equipped is not designed to be:
- a spiritual diagnostic tool
- a personality test
- a replacement for discipleship
- a leadership shortcut
- a one-size-fits-all theology

It does not assume agreement on:
- continuationism vs cessationism
- specific gift frameworks
- ministry structure models

The platform intentionally avoids:
- predictive language
- prescriptive outcomes
- spiritual claims

Its role is supportive and reflective, not declarative.
