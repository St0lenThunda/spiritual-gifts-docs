# Pastor FAQ – Called & Equipped

This FAQ addresses the most common questions pastors and church leaders ask when evaluating Called & Equipped.

---

## Is this a spiritual gifts test?

No.

Called & Equipped is a **discernment support tool**, not a diagnostic test.  
It helps individuals reflect prayerfully on patterns, strengths, and tendencies while always deferring to pastoral wisdom and Scripture.

---

## Does this replace pastoral discernment?

Absolutely not.

The platform is designed to:
- Support conversation
- Provide shared language
- Encourage reflection

Final discernment **always belongs to the Church**, not the software.

---

## Can leaders see individual answers?

No.

Leaders see **summaries and trends**, not personal responses or preferences.

What leaders can see:
- Participation counts
- Aggregate trends
- Ministry-level insights

What leaders cannot see:
- Personal answers
- Theme or language preferences
- Private reflections

---

## Why are results historical, not definitive?

Results represent a **snapshot in time**, not a permanent identity.
Called & Equipped preserves assessment history to:
- Show growth and seasons of life
- Prevent "locking in" a young believer's initial understanding
- Encourage continuous discernment

God moves; our tools should respect that movement.

---

## Can leaders change or override someone’s results?

No.

Results are:
- Generated consistently
- Versioned (not overwritten)
- Owned first by the individual

Leaders are encouraged to **discuss**, not edit.

---

## Is this personality profiling?

No.

The system does not:
- Assign fixed labels
- Rank people
- Predict behavior
- Replace spiritual formation

It intentionally avoids psychological classification models.

---

## How does Scripture fit into the platform?

Scripture is:
- Presented as grounding, not proof-texting
- Localized to the user’s language where possible
- Fallback-safe to prevent missing passages

Scripture supports reflection, not automation.

---

## What about denominational differences?

Called & Equipped is:
- Multi-denominational by design
- Theologically cautious
- Explicit about posture and limits

It does not enforce a single doctrinal interpretation of gifts.

---

## Is our church’s data isolated?

Yes.

Each organization:
- Has its own secure space
- Cannot see other churches’ data
- Is protected by technical and permission boundaries

Demo environments are isolated and read-only.

---

## Are user preferences (themes, language) shared?

No.

Preferences are:
- Private to the individual
- Never visible to admins
- Never used for analytics beyond aggregate counts

---

## Is data sold or shared?

No.

- No advertising
- No data resale
- No external sharing

Data exists only to serve the church that collected it.

---

## Who is this for?

Called & Equipped is ideal for:
- Churches exploring gifts responsibly
- Ministries stewarding volunteers
- Pastors who value discernment over automation

---

## What safeguards are in place?

- Backend-enforced permissions
- Role-based access control
- No admin overrides of personal data
- Clear theological boundaries

---

## In One Sentence

Called & Equipped is a tool that helps churches **listen better**, not decide faster.

---

## Does this assess spiritual gifts?

It provides structured reflection tools. Discernment remains pastoral and communal.

---

## Is this tied to a denomination?

No. Language and usage are adaptable.

---

## Can results be misused?

Safeguards exist, but wise leadership matters. The system is intentionally limited to reduce misuse.

---

## Does this replace discipleship?

No. It supports discipleship by preserving insight and continuity.

---

## What happens if leadership changes?

Historical context remains accessible without locking in past conclusions.

---

## Is this about data?

It’s about stewardship. Data exists only to support care, not control.
