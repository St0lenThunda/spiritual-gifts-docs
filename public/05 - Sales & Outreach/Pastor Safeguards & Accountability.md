# Safeguards & Accountability

Called & Equipped is designed with clear boundaries.

## Pastoral Authority
- The system does not make decisions
- No automated assignments or recommendations
- Pastors retain full interpretive authority

## Privacy
- Individual preferences and reflections are private
- Administrators cannot view personal settings
- Access is role-based and auditable

## Anonymized Strategic Insights (ADR-018)
- **Pattern Discernment:** Organizational analytics are anonymized to focus on congregational patterns rather than individual surveillance.
- **Tenure & Role Analysis:** Insights are grouped by demographic segments (Tenure, Role) to support strategic leadership development without compromising personal trust.
- **Trust Lever:** By "destroying" the potential for individual bias in aggregate views, we "build" a more strategic and objective tool for stewardship.

## Transparency
- Results are visible and explainable
- No hidden scoring logic
- No algorithmic decision-making

## Accountability
- All major system decisions are documented
- The platform includes read-only demo modes
- Features are evaluated through ethical review, not just demand
- **Translucency:** Demo modes are clearly marked to prevent confusion
- **Role Scoping:** Admins are technically restricted to their organization's scope
- **History Traversal:** Past results remain accessible to prevent recency bias

The goal is trust—not efficiency at the expense of care.
