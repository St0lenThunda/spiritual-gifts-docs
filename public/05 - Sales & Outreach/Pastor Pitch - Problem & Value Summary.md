Called & Equipped is a tool designed to support—not replace—pastoral discernment. It provides aggregated organizational insights that protect individual privacy while helping churches thoughtfully gather and steward data on service readiness over time, without prescribing outcomes or enforcing theology. Rather than offering one-time assessments or rigid systems, it provides a structured, accountable way to reflect, revisit, and care for people as they grow—respecting denominational differences and pastoral responsibility.
