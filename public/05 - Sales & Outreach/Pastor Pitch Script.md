# Pastor Pitch Script

## Strongest Pitch Angle

**Do Not Say:** “This is a spiritual gifts test.” (Market is saturated)

**Say:** “A discernment and discipleship platform that helps churches recognize, steward, and deploy spiritual gifts responsibly.”

### Key Emphasis Points
- Biblically grounded
- Leadership oversight
- Longitudinal growth tracking
- Anonymized Strategic Insights (ADR-018)
- Not personality-based
- Not mystical or chaotic

*Neutralizes objections from Reformed churches, Mainline denominations, and Conservative leadership.*
