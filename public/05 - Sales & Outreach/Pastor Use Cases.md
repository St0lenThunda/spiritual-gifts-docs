# How Pastors Use Called & Equipped

## Scenario 1: New Members
A new member completes a reflection-based assessment.
The pastor reviews results privately and uses them as a **conversation starter**, not a placement tool.

## Scenario 2: Volunteer Burnout
Patterns emerge showing the same individuals serving across many areas.
Leaders use this insight to adjust support—not to pressure involvement.

## Scenario 3: Leadership Transition
A new pastor inherits years of ministry context instead of starting from scratch.
Historical insight is preserved without forcing conclusions.

## Scenario 4: Discipleship Conversations
Pastors revisit prior reflections with individuals to discuss growth, change, or redirection.

The system does not speak.
It listens, remembers, and supports follow-up.
