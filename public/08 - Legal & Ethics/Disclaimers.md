# Disclaimers

**Called & Equipped is a tool for reflection, not a voice from Heaven.**

By using this platform, you acknowledge the following limitations:

## 1. Not Prophecy
Our assessments are algorithms designed to mirror your self-reflections back to you. They do **not** replace:
- The confirmation of the Holy Spirit.
- The affirmation of your local church community.
- A lifetime of prayer and discernment.

## 2. Not a Medical Diagnosis
This platform assesses **perceived spiritual inclinations**. It is not a psychological evaluation, personality diagnosis, or mental health tool.

## 3. Not a Hierarchy
We reject the notion that some gifts are "better" or "more spiritual" than others. A result indicating a gift of "Leadership" grants no spiritual authority over a result indicating "Service."

## 4. No Automated Placement
This software does not assign ministry roles. It provides data to **human leaders** (pastors and elders) who bear the full responsibility for prayerful staffing decisions.
