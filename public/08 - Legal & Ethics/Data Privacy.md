# Data Privacy & Stewardship

We treat your spiritual data with "Stewardship," not just "Compliance." This means we recognize that a record of your discernment journey is personal, sensitive, and belongs to you.

## 🔑 Your Data, Your Ownership

Unlike typical church management software where the institution owns the record, Called & Equipped is **User-First**:

1.  **Portability**: Your assessment history belongs to your user profile, not the organization. If you move from one church to another, your history can go with you.
2.  **Access Revocation**: If you leave an organization, their access to your historical data is **immediately revoked**. They cannot "keep" your file without your continued consent.
3.  **Right to Forgetting**: You have the right to request a complete "Holy Deletion" of your account. We do not retain "shadow profiles."

## 🛡️ Administrative Boundaries

To protect against spiritual surveillance:

- **No Secret Settings**: Administrators cannot see your private theme preferences or draft reflections.
- **Aggregate Analytics**: Org leaders see trends (e.g., "30% of our church has the gift of Hospitality"), but individual results are protected until you choose to share them.
- **Audit Logging**: Any time an administrator changes your role or access, it is logged. Power is always accountable.

## ⏳ The "Soft Expiration" Policy

We believe people change. To prevent old results from labeling you forever:

- Results older than **2 years** are marked as "Historical."
- They are excluded from active ministry matchmaking views to ensure you are seen as you are *now*, not who you were back then.
