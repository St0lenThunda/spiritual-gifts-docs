## 🧪 Evaluation Criteria (What Churches Care About)

Each name is tested against:

1. **Doctrinal Safety** – unlikely to trigger theological objections
2. **Pastoral Comfort** – easy to say from pulpit or newsletter
3. **Board / Elder Approval** – sounds serious, not trendy
4. **Charismatic Neutrality** – doesn’t imply tongues/prophecy bias
5. **Growth Headroom** – allows expansion beyond “assessments”

Scores: ⭐ (weak) → ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (excellent)

## 🏆 Name Testing Results

### 1️⃣ **Called & Equipped**

| Criterion              | Score |
| ---------------------- | ----- |
| Doctrinal Safety       | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Pastoral Comfort       | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Board Approval         | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Charismatic Neutrality | ⭐⭐⭐⭐½ |
| Growth Headroom        | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |

**Why it passes**

* Directly biblical (Eph. 4, Rom. 8)
* Safe for Lutheran, Methodist, Anglican, Evangelical, Charismatic
* Sounds like a *ministry*, not software
* Very hard to object to without sounding unbiblical

⚠️ Minor note: some very cessationist leaders may still ask “equipped for what?” — which is actually an opening, not a problem.

✅ **Overall: Strong frontrunner**

---

### 2️⃣ **Formed & Faithful**

| Criterion              | Score |
| ---------------------- | ----- |
| Doctrinal Safety       | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Pastoral Comfort       | ⭐⭐⭐⭐½ |
| Board Approval         | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Charismatic Neutrality | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Growth Headroom        | ⭐⭐⭐⭐  |

**Why it passes**

* Extremely safe for mainline & liturgical churches
* Signals maturity and discipleship
* Almost impossible to criticize

⚠️ Slightly less explicit about *action/service* — more inward-focused

✅ **Best fit for mainline / liturgical contexts**

---

### 3️⃣ **Rooted & Ready**

| Criterion              | Score |
| ---------------------- | ----- |
| Doctrinal Safety       | ⭐⭐⭐⭐½ |
| Pastoral Comfort       | ⭐⭐⭐⭐  |
| Board Approval         | ⭐⭐⭐⭐  |
| Charismatic Neutrality | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Growth Headroom        | ⭐⭐⭐⭐½ |

**Why it passes**

* “Rooted” reassures conservative theology
* “Ready” implies preparation without gifts language

⚠️ Slightly more informal — some boards may see it as less “institutional”

✅ **Great for evangelical / non-denominational churches**

---

### 4️⃣ **Faithful & Prepared**

| Criterion              | Score |
| ---------------------- | ----- |
| Doctrinal Safety       | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Pastoral Comfort       | ⭐⭐⭐⭐½ |
| Board Approval         | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Charismatic Neutrality | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Growth Headroom        | ⭐⭐⭐⭐  |

**Why it passes**

* Very safe, very serious
* Reads well in written materials

⚠️ Slightly passive — less inspiring, more descriptive

✅ **Excellent but less distinctive**

---

### 5️⃣ **Sent & Strengthened**

| Criterion              | Score |
| ---------------------- | ----- |
| Doctrinal Safety       | ⭐⭐⭐⭐  |
| Pastoral Comfort       | ⭐⭐⭐⭐  |
| Board Approval         | ⭐⭐⭐½  |
| Charismatic Neutrality | ⭐⭐⭐½  |
| Growth Headroom        | ⭐⭐⭐⭐½ |

**Why it struggles**

* “Sent” may imply mission/charismatic emphasis
* Some mainline churches will hesitate

⚠️ Best for missional or Pentecostal contexts, weaker elsewhere

❌ **Not ideal for multi-denomination core brand**

---

## 🥇 Final Ranking (Objective)

1. **Called & Equipped** 🏆
2. **Formed & Faithful**
3. **Rooted & Ready**
4. Faithful & Prepared
5. Sent & Strengthened

---

## 🎯 Strategic Recommendation (Important)

### Best primary brand:

**Called & Equipped**

### Best subtitle (this matters):

> **Called & Equipped**
> *A discernment and formation platform for faithful service*

This lets you:

* Talk about **gifts** when appropriate
* Avoid them when not
* Expand into leadership, vocation, and discipleship later
