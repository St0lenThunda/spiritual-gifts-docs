# Brand Voice & Language

Called & Equipped speaks with a voice that is **Pastoral, Clear, and Humble**.

## Our Voice Attributes

| Attribute | What it Means | What it Avoids |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Pastoral** | Caring, precise, and oriented toward growth. | We are not "Salesy" or "Hyped." |
| **Clear** | Simple language, accessible to laypeople. | We avoid theological jargon unless defined. |
| **Humble** | We offer tools, not ultimate answers. | We avoid arrogance or "God-complex" claims. |
| **Honest** | Transparency about what the software can/cannot do. | We do not over-promise. |

## Key Terminology
See [[Terminology Mapping]] for specific word choices (e.g., using "Steward" instead of "Admin").

## Writing Style Guide
- **Capitalization**: Capitalize "Church" when referring to the universal body. Capitalize "Kingdom" when referring to God's Kingdom.
- **Scripture**: Use ESV formatting by default.
- **Tone**: "Come alongside," don't "Talk down."
