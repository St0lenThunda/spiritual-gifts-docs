# Strategic Roadmap Refresh

**Date**: December 21, 2025
**Status**: Completed ✅

## Summary
Updated the project roadmap and technical notes to reflect recent observability enhancements and prioritize future engineering excellence. This update ensures the codebase evolves with best practices in mind, focusing on scalability and developer experience.

## Issues Addressed / Features Added
- **Sanitized Documentation**: Removed redundant entries for API documentation and health check suggestions.
- **Strategic Suggestions Added**:
  - **Observability**: Log retention and rotation for database-backed logs.

  - **Security**: CSRF protection for session cookies.

## Implementation Details
The `project_notes.md` file was refactored to categorize new suggestions clearly using category tags (e.g., `[Architecture]`, `[Security]`). Duplicate blocks were pruned to maintain document clarity.

## Files Created/Modified
- [project_notes.md](file:///home/thunda/Dev/543_Tools/spiritual-gifts/docs/project_notes.md) - Updated suggestions and removed duplicates.

## Verification
