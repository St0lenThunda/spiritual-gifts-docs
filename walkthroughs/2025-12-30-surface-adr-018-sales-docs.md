# Surfacing ADR-018 in Sales Docs

**Date**: December 30, 2025
**Status**: Completed ✅

## Summary
Integrated **ADR-018: Anonymized Analytics Insights** into key sales and pastoral outreach documents. This surfaces our "privacy-first" pattern discernment logic as a primary trust lever for pastors and decision-makers, emphasizing the shift from individual surveillance to strategic organizational stewardship.

## Issues Addressed / Features Added
- Referenced Anonymized Analytics in the Safeguards & Accountability framework.
- Integrated privacy-first messaging into various pitch decks and scripts.
- Strengthened the Security & Trust proposition in the main Sales Pitch.

## Implementation Details
We modified several documents in the `05 - Sales & Outreach` and `00 - Overview` folders to explicitly mention the anonymized nature of the "Insights" dashboard. By citing ADR-018, we provide technical and theological grounding for why we choose to aggregate data rather than list individuals in high-level views.

### Key Changes:
- **Pastor Safeguards & Accountability.md**: Added a dedicated section on Anonymized Strategic Insights.
- **Sales Pitch.md**: Updated the Security & Trust section to include ADR-018.
- **Elevator Pitch.md & Pitch Scripts**: Weaved in "privacy-first aggregate insights" as a core pillar.
