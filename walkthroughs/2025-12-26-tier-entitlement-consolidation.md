# Consolidated Tier Entitlements

**Date**: December 26, 2025
**Status**: Completed ✅

## Summary
Refactored the spiritual gifts assessment tier management from scattered frontend/backend logic into a unified "Entitlement Registry." This move provides a single source of truth for feature flags and usage limits based on subscription plans.

## Issues Addressed / Features Added
- 🛡️ **Single Source of Truth**: Backend now controls all feature limits and flags via the `OrganizationResponse`.
- 🚫 **Strict Enforcement**: The backend now strictly enforces member limits during the invitation process, rather than relying solely on UI-level blocks.
- 🧹 **Code Cleanliness**: Removed redundant `if/else` plan checks in the frontend, replaced by a dynamic `entitlements` mapping.
- 🔄 **Feature Sync**: Aligned backend snake_case limits (e.g., `history_days`) with frontend CamelCase expectations.

## Implementation Details
- **Backend**:
  - `app/services/entitlements.py`: Unified registry of all plan-based limits.
  - `app/schemas.py`: Added `entitlements` field to `OrganizationResponse`.
  - `app/routers/organizations.py`: Populated `entitlements` in all organization routes and added seat-count enforcement to `invite_member`.
- **Frontend**:
  - `src/stores/organization.js`: Refactored `planLimits` to prioritize backend-provided entitlements.

## Files Modified
- `app/schemas.py` - Updated `OrganizationResponse`.
- `app/routers/organizations.py` - Added enforcement and response population.
- `frontend/src/stores/organization.js` - Refactored for dynamic entitlement usage.

## Verification
- Verified API response includes correct entitlement objects for "free" tier (10 users, 30-day history).
- Verified `invite_member` rejects requests when seat limits are exceeded.
- Verified frontend store correctly maps backend data to existing UI feature flags.

## Frontend Cleanup (Legacy Removal)
- **Deleted `useFeatureGate.js`**: Removed unused legacy composable that duplicated entitlement logic.
- **Updated `organization.js`**: Added `analytics` and `manageSubscription` to the fallback plan definitions to ensure proper feature gating even if backend entitlements are missing.
- **Refactored `OrganizationSettings.vue`**: Replaced hardcoded checks for `growth`/`enterprise` plans with semantic `isFeatureEnabled('analytics')` and `isFeatureEnabled('manageSubscription')` checks.
- **Added `branding` Entitlement**: Explicitly added `branding: true` to Ministry and Church plans in the store to fix missing theme controls.
