# FAQ Page Implementation

**Date**: January 2, 2026
**Status**: Completed ✅

## Summary
Implemented a responsive FAQ page with accordion-style questions and answers, integrated into the main navigation. Fully localized for EN, ES, FR, and RU.

## Issues Addressed / Features Added
- Created `/faq` page with "accordion" design for better readability.
- Added "FAQ" link to the main navigation bar.
- Implemented full i18n support for all 4 supported languages.
- Added a "Call to Action" at the bottom of the FAQ to drive users to the assessment.

## Implementation Details
The FAQ page uses `@headlessui/vue` Disclosure components for the accordion effect. The content is stored in the locale JSON files to ensure easy translation management.

## Files Created/Modified
- `frontend/src/pages/FAQ.vue` - New component for the FAQ page.
- `frontend/src/router/index.js` - Added `/faq` route.
- `frontend/src/App.vue` - Added FAQ link to `publicNavigation`.
- `frontend/src/locales/*.json` - Added FAQ content and navigation keys.
- `frontend/.env.development` - Fixed `VITE_API_URL` issue.
- `frontend/src/api/client.js` - Fixed dynamic baseURL resolution.

## Verification
- **Manual Testing**: Verified that the FAQ page loads correctly, questions expand/collapse, and the language switcher updates the content dynamically.
- **Navigation**: Verified the FAQ link appears in the header and works.
